# Skill Progress Evaluation System - Implementation Task Breakdown

This document outlines the implementation tasks for the Skill Progress Evaluation System, as specified in the [Technical Design Document](../tdd/tdd_skill_progress_evaluation.md).

## Overview
The Skill Progress Evaluation System allows users to track improvement in specific skills through multiple evaluation criteria. Users can input daily scores for each criterion, add reflective notes, and visualize progress through charts.

## Task Breakdown Checklist

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- [ ] Add SKILL check_in_type to existing check-in types
- [ ] Create SKILL table with relation to HABIT
- [ ] Create CRITERION table with relation to SKILL
- [ ] Create CRITERION_CHECK_IN table with relation to CHECK_IN and CRITERION
- [ ] Update existing database migration scripts

### 2. Backend API Implementation
- [ ] Extend HabitController with CreateSkill and UpdateSkill methods
- [ ] Extend CheckInController with CreateSkillCheckIn and GetSkillCheckInHistory methods
- [ ] Implement validation for skill and criterion models
- [ ] Add database operations for skills and criteria
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and response formatting

### 3. Frontend Types and Schemas
- [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces for Skill, Criterion, and CriterionCheckIn
- [ ] Create Zod validation schemas for skill creation and check-in
- [ ] Update shared type definitions

### 4. Frontend Form Components
- [ ] Update HabitForm to include skill type option
- [ ] Create CriteriaFieldArray component for managing criteria
- [ ] Create FormSkillCheckIn component for daily evaluations
- [ ] Implement form validation and submission logic

### 5. API Integration Hooks
- [ ] Create useSkillApis hook for skill CRUD operations
- [ ] Extend useCheckInApis for skill check-in operations
- [ ] Implement data fetching and caching with TanStack Query

### 6. Chart Visualization
- [ ] Create SkillProgressChart component
- [ ] Implement data transformation for chart display
- [ ] Add responsive chart UI with proper styling
- [ ] Ensure accessibility for chart elements

### 7. Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Write unit tests for new components and services
- [ ] Perform integration testing for skill creation and check-in flow
- [ ] Test chart visualization with various data sets
- [ ] Verify performance with large datasets

## Dependencies
- Frontend: React Hook Form, Zod, Recharts, TanStack Query
- Backend: Golang, Pocketbase, ozzo-validation
- Database: Pocketbase/SQLite

## Implementation Notes
- All new components should follow the existing MagicHabit architectural patterns
- Maintain consistent user experience with existing habit tracking features
- Ensure proper error handling and validation at all levels
- Consider performance optimization for chart rendering with large datasets
- Follow accessibility guidelines for all UI components

## Definition of Done
- All tasks in the checklist are completed
- Code passes all unit and integration tests
- Features work correctly only on web
- Performance requirements are met (charts load within 2 seconds)
- Code has been reviewed and approved
