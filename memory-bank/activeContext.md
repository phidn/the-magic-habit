- Enhanced error reporting for validation failures
- Created helper text for form fields to guide users

## Active Decisions

### Current Decisions
1. **Visualization approach for multi-criteria progress**
   - Radar/spider charts selected as primary visualization
   - Implementation planning in progress
   - Considering library options for optimal performance

2. **Criteria templates implementation**

   - Ensuring mathematical correctness and intuitive results
   - Addressing edge cases in weight distribution

### Recent Decisions
1. **Multi-Criteria Data Processing Approach**
   - Implemented a date-based grouping strategy in the backend for multi-criteria check-ins
   - Chose to keep criterion-specific values while providing aggregated views
   - Selected maximum level approach for visual representation in heatmap

2. **Criteria UI approach**
   - Selected drag-and-drop interface for reordering
   - Implemented inline editing for better UX
   - Chose slider component for weight assignment

3. **Validation strategy**
   - Implemented real-time validation for immediate feedback
   - Created clear error messaging system
   - Added prevention of duplicate criterion names

4. **Mobile optimization**
   - Redesigned criteria management for touch interfaces
   - Implemented collapsible sections for better space utilization
   - Enhanced touch targets for better mobile accessibility

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete the visualization component for multi-criteria skills using radar/spider charts
2. Implement predefined criteria templates for common skill types
3. Finalize the weighted progress calculation algorithm
4. Complete Telegram integration for notifications and check-ins

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Enhance mobile experience for criteria management
2. Improve performance for users with many habits and criteria
3. Add export functionality for skill tracking data
4. Implement community sharing features for skill templates

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. Future-dated multi-criteria entries may require additional handling
2. Performance concerns with large datasets of criteria
3. Memory leaks in complex components
4. Browser compatibility issues with some rating controls

### UX Concerns
1. Complexity of criteria setup for new users
2. Need for better guidance on weight assignment
3. Mobile interface constraints for criteria management
4. Potential information overload in progress visualization

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Implementing virtualized lists for large criteria sets
