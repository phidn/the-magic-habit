- Added prevention of redundant form submissions
- Optimized form performance for faster response times

### Validation Improvements
- Added comprehensive validation for the criteria section
- Implemented front-end validation to prevent user errors
- Added back-end validation to ensure data integrity
- Enhanced error reporting for validation failures
- Created helper text for form fields to guide users

## Active Decisions

### Current Decisions
1. **Visualization approach for multi-criteria progress**
   - Radar/spider charts selected as primary visualization
   - Implementation planning in progress
   - Considering library options for optimal performance

2. **Criteria templates implementation**
   - Working on predefined templates for common skills
   - Determining the right balance of flexibility vs. guidance
   - Considering community-contributed templates

3. **Weighted averaging algorithm**
   - Finalizing approach for overall skill progress calculation
   - Ensuring mathematical correctness and intuitive results
   - Addressing edge cases in weight distribution

### Recent Decisions
1. **Criteria UI approach**
   - Selected drag-and-drop interface for reordering
   - Implemented inline editing for better UX
   - Chose slider component for weight assignment

2. **Validation strategy**
   - Implemented real-time validation for immediate feedback
   - Created clear error messaging system
   - Added prevention of duplicate criterion names

3. **Mobile optimization**
   - Redesigned criteria management for touch interfaces
   - Implemented collapsible sections for better space utilization
   - Enhanced touch targets for better mobile accessibility

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete the visualization component for multi-criteria skills using radar/spider charts
2. Implement predefined criteria templates for common skill types
3. Finalize the weighted progress calculation algorithm
4. Complete Telegram integration for notifications and check-ins

### Upcoming Tasks
1. Enhance mobile experience for criteria management
2. Improve performance for users with many habits and criteria
3. Add export functionality for skill tracking data
4. Implement community sharing features for skill templates

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. Occasional race condition in multi-criteria updates
2. Performance concerns with large datasets
3. Memory leaks in complex components
4. Browser compatibility issues with some rating controls

### UX Concerns
1. Complexity of criteria setup for new users
2. Need for better guidance on weight assignment
3. Mobile interface constraints for criteria management
4. Potential information overload in progress visualization

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Implementing virtualized lists for large criteria sets
- Optimizing state management for complex form interactions
- Adding caching for frequently accessed habit data
- Improving rendering efficiency for visualization components

### Architecture Improvements
- Refactoring criteria management into standalone component
- Creating reusable form validation utilities
- Enhancing error boundary implementation
- Improving test coverage for criteria-related functionality

## User Experience Notes
