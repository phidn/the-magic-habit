# MagicHabit Active Context

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on completing and refining the core habit tracking functionality, with an emphasis on:

1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Streamlining the habit check-in process
   - Enhancing data visualization for progress tracking
   - Optimizing mobile experiences

2. **Feature Completion**
   - Finalizing widget implementation for external embedding
   - Implementing Telegram notification integration
   - Enhancing habit analytics and insights

3. **Platform Stability**
   - Addressing known bugs and performance issues
   - Improving offline capabilities
   - Enhancing error handling and user feedback

## Recent Changes

### Backend
- Implemented role-based permission system for user access control
- Enhanced habit tracking API with improved streak calculation
- Added widget endpoints for external habit tracking
- Optimized database queries for habit listing and reporting

### Frontend Web
- Redesigned habit dashboard with improved layout and responsiveness
- Added habit statistics visualization components
- Implemented drag-and-drop ordering for habits
- Enhanced form validation and error feedback

### Mobile
- Initial mobile application implementation
- Synchronized core features with web application
- Optimized UI for touch interactions
- Added offline mode for check-ins without connectivity

## Active Decisions

1. **API Structure**
   - Decision to maintain consistent RESTful endpoint patterns
   - Standardizing error responses across all endpoints
   - Implementing consistent validation strategies

2. **State Management**
   - Using TanStack Query for server state and caching
   - Zustand for global application state
   - Local component state for UI-specific behaviors

3. **Authentication Strategy**
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
   - Role-based permissions for fine-grained access control
   - User settings storage and management

4. **UI Component Strategy**
   - Leveraging shadcn/ui for web components
   - React Native Paper for mobile
   - Maintaining consistent design language across platforms

## Next Steps

### Short-term Priorities
1. Complete Telegram notification integration
2. Enhance widget customization options
3. Implement enhanced analytics for habit progress
4. Address outstanding UX issues from user feedback

### Medium-term Goals
1. Develop social features for habit sharing and accountability
2. Implement advanced habit scheduling options
3. Add export/import functionality for user data
4. Create template library for common habits

### Long-term Vision
1. Expand platform with AI-driven habit recommendations
2. Develop public API for third-party integrations
3. Implement advanced visualization and reporting
4. Create ecosystem for habit-based communities

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - Slow initial load time for dashboard with many habits
   - Occasional UI lag during habit reordering
   - Mobile performance issues on older devices

2. **UX Friction Points**
   - Multi-step process for habit creation could be simplified
   - Limited customization for habit visualization
   - Inconsistent loading states across the application

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Backend validation logic duplication
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Test coverage gaps in critical components
