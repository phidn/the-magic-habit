# MagicHabit Product Context

## Problem Statement
Many habit tracking applications make habit formation complex, overwhelming users with too many features and rigid structures. People often abandon habit-building efforts because:
- They set unrealistic goals
- Tools are too complicated to use daily
- There's insufficient feedback about progress
- Existing solutions don't account for the psychology of habit formation

2. **Casual Trackers** - Users who want simple tracking without overwhelming gamification

4. **Developers** - Users who want to integrate habit tracking into their own tools

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity First**: Make the interface so simple that tracking becomes effortless
2. **Flexibility**: Support various habit types (yes/no completion, numeric values, notes)

5. **Customization**: Allow users to organize and personalize their habit dashboard
