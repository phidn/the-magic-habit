- They set unrealistic goals
- Tools are too complicated to use daily
- There's insufficient feedback about progress
- Existing solutions don't account for the psychology of habit formation
- Simple trackers don't support complex skill development with multiple dimensions

3. **Data-Oriented Users** - People who want insights and metrics about their habits
4. **Developers** - Users who want to integrate habit tracking into their own tools
5. **Skill Developers** - Users working on multifaceted skills requiring tracking across multiple criteria
